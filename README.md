## Installation

`npm install --save graphql-ttl-transformer`

## How to use

### Setup custom transformer

Edit `amplify/backend/api/<YOUR_API>/transform.conf.json` and append `"./graphql-ttl-transformer"` to the `transformers` field.

```json
"transformers": [
    "graphql-ttl-transformer"
]
```

### Use @ttl directive

Append `@ttl` to target fields.

```graphql
type ExpiringChatMessage @model {
  id: ID!
  message: String
  expirationUnixTime: Int! @ttl
}
```

It is important that the field you use the directive is of type `Int`, as the expiration timestamp must be in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) format.
